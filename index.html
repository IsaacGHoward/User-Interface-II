            My name is Isaac Howard and this is my portfolio website. Here you will find examples of
            my different projects I complete throughout my Lambda School journey. I will also include
            any person projects I have worked on in the past with proper github repo links for each,
            as well as examples and explanations. <strong>Check back soon for more!</strong>
